The features that do not work are Variable Expansion when there is no space
between them. Wildcards bug when there are more than 3 slashes in the
arguement (eg, /user/bin/*). Subshells work manually for some reason, but I
keep failing the test, and I could not figure out why, Is it possible to get
partial credit? my subshell code is in shell.l. History and Edit mode arent included. The rest of the features work.
