*IMPORTANT*: I currently set my database to hold 99999 students and 99999 faculty members (and therefore only handles 5 digit ID numbers). The variables can be set in lines 18&19. 

I used 4 classes to implement my simple database, (excluding SimpleDatabase.java). I gave the entities extra attributes which were ArrayLists that held information.
EG. Student object had an ArrayList with all the classes enrolled, the corresponding class (of type NewClass) also had an ArrayList which held student ID's of enrolled students.
