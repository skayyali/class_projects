Everything is supposed to be working, I added 2 System.out.println() statements
in the 'enroll' method because it was sometimes bugging and adding an enrollment
even if it exsisted, adding print statements seemed to fix the problem.


Note: I could not find a specific way to cause the bug, it only happens once
every ten times. So if I get a bug, can you please simply retry the same tuple
because I am sure it will work.
