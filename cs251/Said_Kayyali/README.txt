I completed all tasks except for the last steps of task 2 and 3. For task 3, step 4, i believe the implementation is similar to task 3 but Instead of incrementing
an array index, i save the return value of distTo(). I did not have enough time to implement this part. 

Also for the report, When i tried to run the tests, I kept getting an error that said "Bad version number in .class file" and I didnt know why, I am testing over putty form home.
